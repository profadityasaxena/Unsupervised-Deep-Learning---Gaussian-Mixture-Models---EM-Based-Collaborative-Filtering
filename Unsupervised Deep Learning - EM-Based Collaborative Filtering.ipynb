    "# ðŸ“Š Unsupervised Deep Learning: Gaussian Mixture Models & EM-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive course on **Unsupervised Deep Learning**, designed and instructed by **Aditya Saxena**. This course explores the fascinating domain of unsupervised learning, where algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs. You will learn to apply mathematical and algorithmic techniques to understand clustering, probability distributions, and latent variable modelsâ€”all essential for data-driven decision-making in modern machine learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course focuses on practical implementation and theory behind **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** and the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm**, culminating in a real-world application: collaborative filtering and matrix completion using the Netflix dataset. By the end of this journey, you will have built a recommendation system from the ground up using probabilistic principles and iterative optimization techniques. This notebook series is structured modularly, includes two mini-projects per module, and emphasizes interpretability, evaluation, and reproducibility.\n",
