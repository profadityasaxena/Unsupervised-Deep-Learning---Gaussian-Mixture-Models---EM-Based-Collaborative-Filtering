    "# ðŸ“Š Unsupervised Deep Learning: Gaussian Mixture Models & EM-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive course on **Unsupervised Deep Learning**, designed and instructed by **Aditya Saxena**. This course explores the fascinating domain of unsupervised learning, where algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without labeled outputs. You will learn to apply mathematical and algorithmic techniques to understand clustering, probability distributions, and latent variable modelsâ€”all essential for data-driven decision-making in modern machine learning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course focuses on practical implementation and theory behind **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)** and the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm**, culminating in a real-world application: collaborative filtering and matrix completion using the Netflix dataset. By the end of this journey, you will have built a recommendation system from the ground up using probabilistic principles and iterative optimization techniques. This notebook series is structured modularly, includes two mini-projects per module, and emphasizes interpretability, evaluation, and reproducibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module, we begin our journey into unsupervised learningâ€”a branch of machine learning where the goal is to uncover hidden structures or patterns in datasets without the guidance of labeled responses. Unlike supervised learning, where we are provided with input-output pairs, unsupervised learning focuses solely on input data and the discovery of its intrinsic organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn the foundational motivations behind unsupervised learning, its most common techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, and how it forms the backbone of many modern applications including recommendation systems, image segmentation, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection. This module lays the conceptual groundwork for the clustering and matrix completion tasks we will tackle in the coming modules.\n",
